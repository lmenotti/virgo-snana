Smith 1981
Subsequent to discovery, Rosker found the supernova image on a patrol folm exposed on 1980 June 13. My eye estimate puts the magnitude of 1980I at m_pg = 14.4+-0.3 on the date, using a sequnce from Betola (1964). Maza (1980, private communication) found the supernova to be below a plate limit of m_pg ~20 on june 5.1, so the outburst must have occured near june 10.
Dr R. Kennicutt and Dr. S van den Bergh obtained a 1.2m Schmidt plates on July 15.2 and July 16.2 on which dates 1980I was at m_pg 14.9+-0.3
